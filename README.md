Wanted to break out of tutorial hell for a bit and work on an easy project I found a suggestion for on reddit

I've made a rock paper scissors game before, but I had the help of a tutorial, and I really wanted to try it without
any assistance from a book and do it "blind" so to speak.

It's a nice feeling having retained all this information, and it makes me confident I can go forward into learning
something I actually want to learn.  Going to work on moving forward and doing things I want to do now, namely data science
and learning Pandas and how to make stuff with that library.
